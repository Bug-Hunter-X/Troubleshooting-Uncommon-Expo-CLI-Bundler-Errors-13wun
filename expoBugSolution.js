The solution often involves a systematic approach:

1. **Dependency Review:** Carefully examine your `package.json` to identify and resolve conflicting or outdated dependencies.  Use tools like `npm-check-updates` to check for updates.
2. **Clean Build:** Execute `expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo start` to ensure a clean build process.
3. **Metro Config:** If you have a `metro.config.js` file, verify the configurations, particularly those related to transformers, resolvers, and module resolution.
4. **Gradual Dependency Updates:** Update dependencies incrementally to pinpoint the source of conflicts.  Start with the most recently added or updated packages. 
5. **Caching:** Clear the Expo cache using the appropriate command for your operating system (Consult the Expo documentation).
6. **Reproducible Example:**  If possible, create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problematic dependency or configuration.
7. **Debugging Tools:** Utilize debugging tools provided by Expo and Metro to identify specific error points within the build process.
8. **Community Support:** Engage with the Expo community forums for assistance.  The Expo community offers valuable support and solutions.

**Example (Illustrative):**  If a specific package causes problems, try temporarily removing it to confirm the issue.  You might need to adjust your code accordingly to compensate for the missing functionality during the debugging process. Then, if the removal resolves the error, gradually update the package to newer versions until you pinpoint a conflicting version.
