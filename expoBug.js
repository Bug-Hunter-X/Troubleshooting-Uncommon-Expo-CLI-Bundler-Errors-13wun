This error occurs when using Expo CLI and you encounter issues related to the bundler, especially when dealing with large projects or complex dependencies. It can manifest in various ways, such as slow build times, unexpected errors during the build process, or even complete build failures.  The root cause can be difficult to pinpoint, as it often stems from interactions between different packages and configurations. For instance, conflicting versions of dependencies, incorrect configuration settings (like those related to Metro bundler), or improperly structured project files can all contribute to these bundler errors. The error messages themselves might not always be clear, making debugging more challenging.
